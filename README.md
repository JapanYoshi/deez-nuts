# About
**The Ligma–Johnson Lexicon** is a documentation of “Deez Nuts” Bait Setups compiled by Dr. Khan U. Ligma and Dr. Wilma Johnson. Khan U. Ligma balls and Wilma Johnson fit in your mouth?

In all seriousness, this is a repo that houses a non-exhaustive list of “ligma”-type joke/prank setups and how to use them. Most of them are in English, but there are some in Spanish and Indonesian too.
